CryptoVideoWatch

This repo includes the code for a Simple Crypto Videos Aggregator. A live version here: https://cryptovideowatch.com/
It's using the YouTube API along with vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Jquery to create an app that aggregates and presents videos from select YouTube channels. 

Comments on my code are welcome. Contributions, too. 

The app can be extended to work with a Database, where videos will be stored. This feature is semi-done with Firebase, not included here yet.
