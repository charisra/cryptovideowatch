CryptoVideoWatch

This repo includes the code for a Simple Crypto Videos Aggregator found in its live version here: https://cryptovideowatch.com/
I used the YouTube API along with Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Jquery to create a simple app that aggregates and presents videos from selected YouTube channels. 

Comments on my code are welcome. Contributions, too. 

The app can be extended to work with a Database, where videos will be stored. I semi-created this implementation with Firebase, not yet included here.
